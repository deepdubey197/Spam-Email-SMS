# Spam-Email-SMS
This project is a web application for classifying text as spam or not spam using a neural network model. Built with Flask, the application allows users to input text and receive real-time classification results. The model is trained using a dataset of emails and SMS messages, and it employs TF-IDF for text feature extraction.
